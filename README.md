‚ÄòMarbon‚Äô is an environmental protection solution aimed at reducing digital carbon footprints. Our goal is to save the planet with small efforts from people all around the world. The project name 'Marbon' is a combination of 'Mail' and 'Carbon', which signifies the aim of reducing carbon emissions by deleting unnecessary emails.

# ‚ùóÔ∏èIntroduction
One of the biggest problems humanity is facing today is global warming. One of the contributing factors is the digital carbon footprint generated by using digital devices and services, such as email services that require significant amounts of power and energy for server and data center operation and maintenance. This can directly lead to an increase in global warming.

To address this issue, Marbon suggests integrating multiple email accounts to enable sorting and deleting unnecessary emails. The classification includes spam, payment and promotion, and SNS. The UI displays the carbon reduction amount based on the number of deleted emails, and badges are awarded considering app attendance, number of deleted emails, and the proportion of deleted emails to the total. This encourages and motivates users to maintain a sustainable digital lifestyle.
